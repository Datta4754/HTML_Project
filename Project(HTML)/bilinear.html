    <h1 style="text-align:center;">DESIGN OF IIR FILTERS USING BILINEAR TRANSFORMATION</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IIR filter can be designed using (a) approximation of derivatives method and (b) Impulse 
        invariant transformation method. However the IIR filter design using these methods is 
        appropriate only for the design of low-pass filters and band pass filters whose resonant 
        frequencies are small. These techniques are not suitable for high-pass or band rejects filters. The 
        limitation is overcome in the mapping technique called the bilinear transformation. This 
        transformation is a one-to-one mapping from the s-domain to the z-domain. That is, the bilinear 
        transformation is a conformal mapping that transforms the imaginary axis of s-plane into the unit 
        circle in the z-plane only once, thus avoiding aliasing of frequency components. In this mapping, 
        all points in the left half of s-plane are mapped inside the unit circle in the z-plane, and all points 
        in the right half of s-plane are mapped outside the unit circle in the z-plane. So the 
        transformation of a stable analog filter results in stable digital filter. The bilinear transformation 
        can be obtained by using the trapezoidal formula for the numerical integration.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the system function of the analog filter be</p>

        <p>The differential equation describing the above analog filter can be obtained as:</p>
        <p><img src="IMG_20220716_130402.JPG"></p>
        <p>Taking inverse Laplace transform on both sides and applying z transform, we get</p>

        <p>Comparing this with the analog filter system function Ha(s) we get</p>

        <p> The general characteristic of the mapping z = e
            sT may be obtained by</p>

        <p><img src="IMG_20220716_131152.JPG"></p>
        <p>From the above equation for , we observe that if r < 1 then σ < 0 and if r > 1, then σ > 
            0, and if r = 1, then σ = 0. Hence the left half of the s-plane maps into points inside
            the unit circle in the z-plane, the right half of the s-plane maps into points outside the unit 
            circle in the z-plane and the imaginary axis of s-plane maps into the unit circle in the z-plane. 
            This transformation results in a stable digital system.

    <p>The effect of warping on the magnitude response can be explained by considering an 
        analog filter with a number of passbands as shown in Figure 2(a). The corresponding digital 
        filter will have same number of passbands, but with disproportionate bandwidth</p>
    <p>In designing digital filter using bilinear transformation, the effect of warping on 
        amplitude response can be eliminated by prewarping the analog filter. In this method, the 
        specified digital frequencies are converted to analog equivalent using the equation
        These analog frequencies are called prewarp frequencies. Using the prewarp
        frequencies, the analog filter transfer function is designed, and then it is transformed to digital 
        filter transfer function.
        This effect of warping on the phase response can be explained by considering an analog 
        filter with linear phase response as shown in Figure 2(b). The phase response of corresponding
        digital filter will be nonlinear</p>
    <p><img src="IMG_20220716_131211.JPG"></p>
    <p>It can be stated that the bilinear transformation preserves the magnitude response of an 
        analog filter only if the specification requires piecewise constant magnitude, but the phase 
        response of the analog filter is not preserved. Therefore, the bilinear transformation can be used 
        only to design digital filters with prescribed magnitude response with piecewise constant 
        values. A linear phase analog filter cannot be transformed into a linear phase digital filter 
    using bilinear transformation.</p>
