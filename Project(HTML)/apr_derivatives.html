    <h1 style="text-align:center;"> DESIGN OF IIR FILTER BY APPROXIMATION OF DERIVATIVES</h1>
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analog filter having the rational system function H(s) can also be described by the linear
        constant coefficient differential equations</P>
       <p><img src="Screenshot_20220715_220337.JPG"></p> 
    <p>In this method of IIR filter design by approximation of derivatives, an analog filter is
        converted into a digital filter by approximating the above differential equation into an
        equivalent difference equation</p>
    <p>The backward difference formula is substituted for the derivative which is given by</p>
    <p><img src="IMG_20220715_220501.JPG"></p>
    <p>Also, the second derivative can be replaced by backward difference equation</p>

    <p>The ith derivative of function y(t) results in the equivalent frequency domain relationship as</p>

    <p>Substituting s=jw in the expression for z, we get</p>
    <p><img src="IMG_20220715_220816.JPG"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be observed that the mapping of the equation s = (1 – z
        –1)/T, takes the left half
        plane of s-domain into the corresponding points inside the circle of radius 0.5 and centre at
        z = 0.5. Also the right half of the s-plane is mapped outside the unit circle. Because of this,
        this mapping results in a stable analog filter transformed into a stable digital filter. However,
        since the location of poles in the z-domain are confined to smaller frequencies, this design
        method can be used only for transforming analog low-pass filters and band pass filters which
        are having smaller resonant frequencies. This means that neither a high-pass filter nor a
        band-reject filter can be realized using this technique</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forward difference can be substituted for the derivative instead of the backward
        difference.</p>
    <p>The mapping os s-plane into z plane by backward difference method is depicted in the figure shown below:</p>
    <p><img src="IMG_20220715_223656.JPG"></p>
    <p>The limitations of the mapping methods discussed above can be overcome by using
        more complex substitution for the derivatives. An Nth order difference is proposed for the
        derivative, as shown</p>

    <h4>EXAMPLE</h4>
    <p>Convert the analog low pass filter represented by</p>
    <p><img src="IMG_20220715_224847.JPG"></p>
    <p>into a digital filter making use of backward difference of derivation</p>
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p>We know that mapping formula for backward difference of derivative is given by,</p>

    <P> For the given anlog transfer function the corresponding digital transfer function is given by,</P>
